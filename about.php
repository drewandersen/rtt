    <h2>About Reistance Training Tracker</h2>
    
    <p>The Resistance Training Tracker is a web application develped by Drew Andersen to keep track of the resistance training program he adopted called Stronglifts 5x5. The program rotates between two workouts, each consisting of three different exercies at five sets of five reps. Read more about Stronglifts 5x5 <a href="http://stronglifts.com/5x5/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Version 1 of the tracker, seen here, uses a combination of HTML and PHP to exchange data with a LAMP stack web server installed on a Raspberry Pi. Because the exercises change each day, this app reads the last three entries in the server to determine what information to display.</p>
